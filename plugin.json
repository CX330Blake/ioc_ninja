Findings are presented in an interactive Qt UI with selectable detectors, incremental results, live-domain filtering, and CSV export.\n\n**Why this is useful**\n\n- Quickly surface potential IoCs embedded in binaries without writing custom extraction scripts.\n- A large, curated set of regular expressions and heuristics for many IoC classes (see `ioc_logic.py`).\n- Optional DNS-based live-domain filtering to reduce false positives.\n- Background scanning with incremental UI updates and exportable CSV output for triage.\n\n",
    "longdescription": "## Features\n\n- Pattern-based detection for IPv4/IPv6, domains, URLs, emails, UUIDs, MACs, MD5/SHA hashes, JWTs, API keys, PEM blocks, Base64 blocks, file paths, registry keys and more.\n- Heuristic checks: high-entropy tokens, base64 decode validation and file-hash extraction.\n- GUI: choose detectors, run scans in background, view incremental and aggregated results, export to CSV.\n- Live DNS filtering: optionally show only resolvable domains.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Binary Ninja (minimum version referenced in `plugin.json`: 3164)\n- Python 3 (Binary Ninja's bundled Python is recommended)\n- The plugin uses the Binary Ninja API and PySide6; these are typically supplied by the Binary Ninja application.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone the repository and put `ioc_ninja` inside your Binary Ninja `plugins` directory.\n\n    - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Binary Ninja/plugins/`\n    - Linux: `~/.binaryninja/plugins/`\n    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\\\Binary Ninja\\\\plugins/`\n\n2. Restart Binary Ninja to load the plugin.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Open a binary in Binary Ninja.\n2. Open the plugin UI: `Plugins -> IoC Ninja` (or use the command palette).\n3. Select IoC types to scan (or use the All/None shortcuts) and click `Scan`.\n4. Watch progress and partial results in the UI. Use the search box to filter by Type, Value, or Address.\n5. Export results using the `Export` button (CSV) for further triage.\n\n## Developer & Testing\n\n- Core logic: `ioc_ninja/core/ioc_logic.py`\n- UI: `ioc_ninja/ui/ioc_ui.py`\n- Compatibility shim for legacy imports: `ioc_ninja/logic/ioc_logic.py`\n- Tests: `tests/test_ioc_regex.py` (mocks Binary Ninja internals so tests can run outside the host application).\n\nRun unit tests locally (Python 3 required):\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pytest tests/test_ioc_regex.py\n# or (tests include a small runner):\npython3 tests/test_ioc_regex.py\n```\n\nWhen adding or changing detectors, please add/update tests in `tests/test_ioc_regex.py` to cover edge cases.\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Open an issue in this repository for bugs or feature requests. Include: Binary Ninja version, small repro if possible, and steps to reproduce.\n- For quick questions, code pointers, or to propose changes, open a discussion or PR.\n\n## Contributing & Maintainers\n\n- This project is maintained in this repository. See `LICENSE` for license details (MIT).\n- Contributions are welcome via pull requests \u2014 for larger changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License \u2014 see `LICENSE` for details.\n",
